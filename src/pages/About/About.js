              Since I was young, I have enjoyed solving hard problems such as math
              or puzzle in one sitting, for hours. Whenever I got stuck on one
              difficult problem, I spend times as much as I need until I get the
              answer. The harder the problem is, the more I enjoyed it.

              I took a programming course in high school. The more I learned to code, the
              more concepts got harder and it could be as deeper as it can be. I
              found computers and the world that resides in computers very
              fascinating and beautiful because of their complexity.

              I am a graduate of computer networking and recently transitioned into web
              development. I am really excited about the next phase of my learning
              where I can pursue my passion for coding and continue to grow as a
              developer!
