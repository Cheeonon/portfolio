            Ever since I was young, I've really enjoyed solving tough problems like math puzzles. I would spend hours working on them, not giving up until I found the answer. The harder the problem, the more I liked it.

            <p className="about__paragraph">
            In high school, I took a programming class and as I learned more, the concepts became more challenging. I found computers and everything related to them really fascinating because they are so complex.
            </p>

            I graduated in computer networking and recently switched to web development. I'm really excited about this new phase of learning where I can pursue my passion for coding and keep growing as a developer!
